BUGSnet (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling to conduct NETwork meta-analysis) is a feature-rich R package to conduct Bayesian network meta-analyses in compliance with best practice and reporting guidelines. Bayesian analyses are conducted with JAGS, and BUGS code is automatically generated by the package based on the user's inputs. Outputs are highly customizable and include network plots, tables of network characteristics, league tables and league heat plots, SUCRA plots, rankograms, forest plots, leverage plots, traceplots, posterior mean deviance comparison plots.

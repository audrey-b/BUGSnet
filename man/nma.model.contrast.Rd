\arguments{
\item{data_contrast}{A \code{BUGSnetData} object containing the data from contrast-based trials produced by \code{data.prep()}}

\item{differences}{A string indicating the name of the differences for contrast-based studies}

\item{se.diffs}{A string indicating the variable name of the standard errors of the differences.}

\item{var.arm1}{A string (only required for networks with multi-arm trials) indicating the variable name of the variance of the treatment in arm 1 of each study}

\item{reference}{A string for the treatment that will be seen as the 'referent' comparator and labeled as treatment 1 in the BUGS code. This is often
a placebo or control drug of some kind.}

\item{type}{If type="inconsistency", an inconsistency model will be built. By default, type="consistency" and a consistency model is built.
will be built.}

\item{effects}{A string indicating the type of treatment effect relative to baseline. Options are "fixed" or "random".}

\item{scale}{A string indicating the scale of the data, such as "Mean Difference" or "Log-Odds Ratio",}

\item{prior.mu}{A string of BUGS code that defines priors on the baseline treatment effects. By default, independent normal priors are used with mean 0 and standard deviation 15u, where u is the largest maximum likelihood estimator in single trials \insertCite{@see @gemtc}{BUGSnet}.}

\item{prior.d}{A string of BUGS code that defines define priors on relative treatment effects. By default, independent normal priors are used with mean 0 and standard deviation 15u, where u is the largest maximum likelihood estimator in single trials \insertCite{@see @gemtc}{BUGSnet}.}

\item{prior.sigma}{A string of BUGS code that defines the prior on the variance of relative treatment effects. By default, a uniform distribution with range 0 to u is used, where u is the largest maximum likelihood estimator in single trials \insertCite{@see @gemtc}{BUGSnet}.}
}
\value{
\code{nma.model} returns an object of class \code{BUGSnetModel} which is a list containing the following components:

\code{bugs} - A long character string containing BUGS code that will be run in \code{jags}.

\code{data} - The data used in the BUGS code.

\code{scale} - The scale of the outcome, based on the chosen family and link function
examples are "Risk Ratio" (relative risk), "Odds Ratio", "Mean Difference", "Hazard Ratio"

\code{trt.key} - Treatments mapped to integer numbers, used to run BUGS code.

\description{
Creates BUGS code which can be ran through \code{nma.run()}.
